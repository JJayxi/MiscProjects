# Miscellaneous projects
Projects that are too small to have their own repo but are still kinda cool. All these projects were made without copying and purely as an exploration or experimantation with code without sources. They are not fully fledged projects.

## ChristmasAnimation
A fully procedural christmas animation written in Processing for a coding competition on internet.
Uses perlin noise to have smooth wind effect. Some parallax to add 3d sense.

## FibonacciSpiral
Contains a Basic and an Advanced project. The Basic tries to draw the fibonacci spiral with the least amount of lines (10 lines).

The more advanced changes the shape of the spiral according to the user mouse position.

## NormalMapVisualiser
Uses vector multiplication to create shadows on an image using a normal map. Was made just to try out how effective a normal map is. The light position is the position of the cursor.

## Text Imitation
This program written in Python analysis the probability of a letter following some sequence of other letters (the length of which can be changed), generates new text based on some large document. Provided here are many text files such as odyssey, hamlet or the english dictionnary.

```
It is not english but imitates it. The context for why this has been coded is to have space-holder text whilst designing a website.
## VisualMemoryTrainer
Program that shows a pattern for a show time and you have to remember it and copy it. 
![An example of a pattern shown](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/832264159193333760/1082420792287035432/image.png)
## VoxelTerrain
VoxelTerrain is a more ellaborate program written in Processing, that allows the user to draw with a circle of variable size (adjustable with the mouse scroll wheel). The iteration of the user affect a quadtree, which changes shape depending on where the user removes and adds stuff. The user can then press `r` which shoots rays out of the mouse in every direction. A quadtree ray traversal is performed, and a collision of the ray with the quadtree stops its path. The user can also press `t` to hide the quadtree.

## WaveInterference

A project made for a science professor who wanted a program to see what places on an interference pattern of two points emiting waves that are static.
